# AI-Based Online Exam Proctoring System

An AI-assisted proctoring system for online exams using:
- Live webcam monitoring (computer vision)
- Background audio monitoring
- Browser tab-switch detection
- Real-time alerts and activity logging

This project is split into:
- `backend/` (Flask server + proctoring logic)
- `frontend/` (simple web UI served by Flask)

---

## Features

- Webcam live stream (MJPEG)
- Face detection
  - “No face detected” / “Face detected - OK” / “Multiple faces detected” overlays
- Head movement monitoring (MediaPipe FaceMesh)
- Background voice detection
- Tab switching detection (browser visibility change)
- Suspicion score + latest alert in UI
- Admin logs page (SQLite)

---

## Project Structure

- `backend/app.py`
  - Flask app
  - Video streaming endpoint
  - Start/stop exam endpoints
  - Suspicion score + alert endpoints
- `backend/proctoring/`
  - `face_detection.py`
  - `eye_head_detection.py`
  - `audio_detection.py`
  - `screen_monitor.py`
  - `alert_engine.py`
- `backend/database/`
  - `db.py` (SQLite logging)
  - `exam_logs.db`
- `frontend/index.html`
  - Main proctoring UI
- `frontend/exam.js`
  - Calls backend APIs (start/stop, score/alerts polling, tab-switch events)
- `frontend/admin.html`
  - Admin logs page template


## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (project is currently tuned/tested on Windows)
- Python 3.9+ recommended
- A working webcam
- Microphone access (for background voice detection)


## Setup (Recommended)

### 1) Create and activate virtual environment

From the project root:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate


### 2) Install dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt


If `pyaudio` fails to install on Windows, see Troubleshooting below.


## Run the Project

### 1) Start the backend

Run from `backend/` folder:

cd backend
python app.py


By default the server runs on:
- `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

### 2) Open the UI

Open this URL in your browser:
- `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

Do **not** open `frontend/index.html` directly as a file, because it’s designed to work with the Flask server.


## How to Use

- **Start Exam**: begins proctoring rules (face/head/audio/tab monitoring)
- **Stop Exam**: stops proctoring rules
- The UI shows:
  - Live video feed
  - Suspicion score
  - Latest alert

### Admin Logs

Open:
- `http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin/logs`

This page reads from SQLite database `backend/exam_logs.db`.


## API Endpoints

- `GET /` : main UI
- `GET /video_feed` : MJPEG webcam stream
- `GET /start_exam` : start exam session
- `GET /stop_exam` : stop exam session
- `GET /suspicion_score` : returns `{ "score": <int> }`
- `GET /latest_alert` : returns last alert object `{ message, level, time }`
- `POST /tab_switched` : logs a tab switch (only when exam is running)


## Performance Notes (FPS)

The backend uses a threaded pipeline:
- Capture thread reads the latest webcam frame continuously
- Detection thread runs vision checks at a lower frequency
- Audio thread runs periodically

This design keeps the video stream smoother and prevents heavy detection from blocking the stream.


## Troubleshooting

### Camera not showing / blank video

- Close apps that may be using the camera (Zoom/Teams/Camera app).
- Check Windows permissions:
  - Settings → Privacy & security → Camera → allow desktop apps
- If you have multiple cameras, you may need to change the camera index in `backend/app.py`.

### PyAudio installation issues (Windows)

If `pip install pyaudio` fails:
- Try installing a prebuilt wheel that matches your Python version, or
- Use a package manager that provides wheels for Windows.

### Background voice detection too sensitive

- Reduce mic gain in Windows Sound settings.
- Increase the check interval / cooldown in `backend/app.py`.


## Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- SpeechRecognition + PyAudio
- SQLite
